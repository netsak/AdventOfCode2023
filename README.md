# My Philosophy
This year I have a little bit of time again to spare on this great challenge.
Since I have the pleasure to work again with Go in my new job I decided to
use Go here as well this year. 

Same procedure as last year, I stick to the plain language and use no libraries
at all. And again I try to anticipate the second part while developing the
solution for the first part, so in hindsight the first part's solution might 
not be optimal `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
